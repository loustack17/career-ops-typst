# Mode: deep — Deep Research Prompt

## Language

This mode is **user-facing**: the output is a research/interview-prep doc the
user reads, not application content sent to the company. Override the shared
"language of the JD (EN default)" rule for this mode and resolve the output
language in this order:

1. **User prompt language** — if the user wrote `/career-ops deep` or its surrounding chat in Spanish, French, German, Japanese, etc., emit the doc in that language.
2. **`config/profile.yml`** — if `language.modes_dir` is set (`modes/de`, `modes/fr`, `modes/ja`), prefer that locale.
3. **JD language** — only as a last resort, when the user prompt has no language signal, e.g. a bare URL with no surrounding chat.

The template below is written in English as a scaffold. Translate it to the resolved output language before presenting.

Generates a structured prompt for Perplexity/Claude/ChatGPT with 6 axes:
