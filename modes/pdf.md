# Mode: pdf — ATS-Optimized PDF Generation

## Full pipeline

1. Read `cv.md` as source of truth
2. Ask the user for the JD if not in context (text or URL)
3. Extract 15-20 keywords from the JD
4. Detect JD language → CV language (EN default)
5. Detect company location → paper format:
   - US/Canada → `letter`
   - Rest of world → `a4`
6. Detect role archetype → adapt framing
7. Rewrite Professional Summary injecting JD keywords + exit narrative bridge ("Built and sold a business. Now applying systems thinking to [JD domain].")
8. If cv.md has a dedicated Projects section with personal/side/open-source projects, select top 3-4 most relevant for the offer. If no such section exists, leave `projects` as an empty array — NEVER synthesize projects from paid work experience
9. Reorder experience bullets by JD relevance
10. Build competency grid from JD requirements (6-8 keyword phrases)
11. Inject keywords naturally into existing achievements (NEVER invent)
12. Build a temporary payload with CV overrides for this offer
13. Read `candidate.full_name` from `config/profile.yml` → normalize to kebab-case lowercase (e.g. "John Doe" → "john-doe") → `{candidate}`
14. Write payload to `/tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.json`
15. Run: `node generate-pdf.mjs cv.md output/cv-{candidate}-{company}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf --payload=/tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.json --format={letter|a4}`
16. If for any reason a temporary `.json` was generated inside `output/`, delete it when done. `output/` must contain the final PDF, not temporary payloads.
17. Report: PDF path, page count, % keyword coverage

## ATS Rules (clean parsing)

- Single-column layout (no sidebars, no parallel columns)
- Standard headers: "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Certifications", "Projects"
- No text in images/SVGs
- No critical info in PDF headers/footers (ATS ignores them)
- UTF-8, selectable text (not rasterized)
- No nested tables
- JD keywords distributed: Summary (top 5), first bullet of each role, Skills section

## PDF Design

- **Renderer**: Modular Typst template (`templates/cv.typ` + `templates/cv/*.typ`)
- **Fonts**: heading/body fonts chosen by the template, matching the active CV design as closely as possible
- **Header**: name in Space Grotesk 24px bold + gradient line `linear-gradient(to right, hsl(187,74%,32%), hsl(270,70%,45%))` 2px + contact row
- **Section headers**: Space Grotesk 13px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em, color cyan primary
- **Body**: DM Sans 11px, line-height 1.5
- **Company names**: color accent purple `hsl(270,70%,45%)`
- **Margins**: 0.45in top/bottom, 0.5in left/right
- **Background**: pure white

## Section order (optimized "6-second recruiter scan")

1. Header (large name, gradient, contact, portfolio link)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 lines, keyword-dense)
3. Core Competencies (6-8 keyword phrases in flex-grid)
4. Work Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Projects (only if cv.md has a dedicated Projects section; omit otherwise)
6. Education & Certifications
7. Skills (languages + technical)

## Keyword injection strategy (ethical, truth-based)

Examples of legitimate rewording:
- JD says "RAG pipelines" and CV says "LLM workflows with retrieval" → change to "RAG pipeline design and LLM orchestration workflows"
- JD says "MLOps" and CV says "observability, evals, error handling" → change to "MLOps and observability: evals, error handling, cost monitoring"
- JD says "stakeholder management" and CV says "collaborated with team" → change to "stakeholder management across engineering, operations, and business"

**NEVER add skills the candidate does not have. Only rephrase real experience using the exact vocabulary from the JD.**

## Temporary payload for Typst

Use `cv.md` as source of truth and generate only a temporary payload with overrides for this offer. Do not generate full HTML or a full Typst document.
Do not save JSON payloads in `output/`.

Expected fields in `/tmp/cv-{candidate}-{company}.json`:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `meta.company` | Company |
| `meta.role` | Role |
| `meta.paper_size` | `letter` or `a4` |
| `meta.source_jd` | JD URL or path |
| `meta.source_report` | Report path |
| `summary` | Custom summary with keywords |
| `core_competencies` | 6-8 capability phrases |
| `experience` | Roles with reordered bullets |
| `projects` | Top 0-4 personal/side/open-source projects from cv.md Projects section. Empty array `[]` if none exist — NEVER extract from work experience |
| `education` | Override only if needed |
| `certifications` | Override only if needed |
| `skills` | Final skill list for this offer |

The Typst renderer lives in `templates/cv.typ` and its modules in `templates/cv/*.typ`. Reuse the existing design; do not recreate it from scratch.

## Canva CV Generation (optional)

If `config/profile.yml` has `cv.canva_resume_design_id` set, offer the user a choice before generating:
- **"HTML/PDF (fast, ATS-optimized)"** — existing flow above
- **"Canva CV (visual, design-preserving)"** — new flow below

If the user has no `cv.canva_resume_design_id`, skip this prompt and use the HTML/PDF flow.

### Canva workflow

#### Step 1 — Duplicate the base design

a. `export-design` the base design (using `cv.canva_resume_design_id`) as PDF → get download URL
b. `import-design-from-url` using that download URL → creates a new editable design (the duplicate)
c. Note the new `design_id` for the duplicate

#### Step 2 — Read the design structure

a. `get-design-content` on the new design → returns all text elements (richtexts) with their content
b. Map text elements to CV sections by content matching:
   - Look for the candidate's name → header section
   - Look for "Summary" or "Professional Summary" → summary section
   - Look for company names from cv.md → experience sections
   - Look for degree/school names → education section
   - Look for skill keywords → skills section
c. If mapping fails, show the user what was found and ask for guidance

#### Step 3 — Generate tailored content

Same content generation as the HTML flow (Steps 1-11 above):
- Rewrite Professional Summary with JD keywords + exit narrative
- Reorder experience bullets by JD relevance
- Select top competencies from JD requirements
- Inject keywords naturally (NEVER invent)

**IMPORTANT — Character budget rule:** Each replacement text MUST be approximately the same length as the original text it replaces (within ±15% character count). If tailored content is longer, condense it. The Canva design has fixed-size text boxes — longer text causes overlapping with adjacent elements. Count the characters in each original element from Step 2 and enforce this budget when generating replacements.

#### Step 4 — Apply edits

a. `start-editing-transaction` on the duplicate design
b. `perform-editing-operations` with `find_and_replace_text` for each section:
   - Replace summary text with tailored summary
   - Replace each experience bullet with reordered/rewritten bullets
   - Replace competency/skills text with JD-matched terms
   - Replace project descriptions with top relevant projects
c. **Reflow layout after text replacement:**
   After applying all text replacements, the text boxes auto-resize but neighboring elements stay in place. This causes uneven spacing between work experience sections. Fix this:
   1. Read the updated element positions and dimensions from the `perform-editing-operations` response
   2. For each work experience section (top to bottom), calculate where the bullets text box ends: `end_y = top + height`
   3. The next section's header should start at `end_y + consistent_gap` (use the original gap from the template, typically ~30px)
   4. Use `position_element` to move the next section's date, company name, role title, and bullets elements to maintain even spacing
   5. Repeat for all work experience sections
d. **Verify layout before commit:**
   - `get-design-thumbnail` with the transaction_id and page_index=1
   - Visually inspect the thumbnail for: text overlapping, uneven spacing, text cut off, text too small
   - If issues remain, adjust with `position_element`, `resize_element`, or `format_text`
   - Repeat until layout is clean
d. Show the user the final preview and ask for approval
e. `commit-editing-transaction` to save (ONLY after user approval)

#### Step 5 — Export and download PDF

a. `export-design` the duplicate as PDF (format: a4 or letter based on JD location)
b. **IMMEDIATELY** download the PDF using Bash:
   ```bash
   curl -sL -o "output/cv-{candidate}-{company}-canva-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf" "{download_url}"
   ```
   The export URL is a pre-signed S3 link that expires in ~2 hours. Download it right away.
c. Verify the download:
   ```bash
   file output/cv-{candidate}-{company}-canva-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf
   ```
   Must show "PDF document". If it shows XML or HTML, the URL expired — re-export and retry.
d. Report: PDF path, file size, Canva design URL (for manual tweaking)

#### Error handling

- If `import-design-from-url` fails → fall back to HTML/PDF pipeline with message
- If text elements can't be mapped → warn user, show what was found, ask for manual mapping
- If `find_and_replace_text` finds no matches → try broader substring matching
- Always provide the Canva design URL so the user can edit manually if auto-edit fails
